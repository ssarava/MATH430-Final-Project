# Projective Geometry Visualizer in Computer Vision

This Python application provides an interactive demonstration of projective geometry concepts through two main features:
1. **Perspective Correction Tool:** Select four corners of a document/planar object and warp it to a frontal view
2. **Image Stitching Demo:** Combine overlapping images using homography estimation
